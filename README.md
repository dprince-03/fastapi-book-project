Deployment
This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The CI pipeline runs tests on pull requests, and the CD pipeline deploys the application to Render when changes are merged into the main branch.

Deploying to Render
Create a Render web service and connect your GitHub repository.

Add the RENDER_API_KEY and RENDER_SERVICE_ID secrets to GitHub.

Push changes to the main branch to trigger the CD pipeline.

Contributing
Fork the repository.

Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature).

Commit changes (git commit -m 'Add AmazingFeature').

Push to branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature).

### **Key Changes**

1. **Added the Deployment Section**:

   - The **Deployment** section explains how to deploy the application to Render using GitHub Actions.
   - It includes steps for setting up Render and triggering the CD pipeline.
2. **Kept the Existing Structure**:

   - The rest of the `README.md` file remains unchanged, ensuring all existing information (e.g., installation, API endpoints, testing) is preserved.

---

### **Why This Matters**

- **Clarity**: The `README.md` file now provides a complete guide for setting up, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Reproducibility**: Anyone who clones your repository can follow the instructions to run the application locally or deploy it to Render.
- **Professionalism**: A well-documented project demonstrates attention to detail and makes it easier for others to contribute or use your work.

---

### **Final Checklist**

- [X] The `README.md` file includes the **Deployment** section.
- [X] The deployment instructions are clear and accurate.
- [X] The application is deployed to Render and publicly accessible.
- [X] All tests pass, and the application works as expected.
